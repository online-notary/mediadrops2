        </h3>
    
<p>We take all reasonable security precautions to protect your personal information provided to our online and mobile resources. Our enterprise-wide corporate information security program includes technical, organizational, administrative, and other measures designed to protect your information from potential threats, in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws.</p>
<p>However, we cannot guarantee that your information, whether in transit, stored on our systems, or otherwise under our care, will be completely free from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, destruction, or alteration. While we maintain the Security Program, we disclaim liability for any theft, loss, unauthorized access, or damage to data, including personal information.</p>
<p>Additionally, third-party companies we work with may have access to your information as part of their services. Although we require these third parties to enter into confidentiality agreements and comply with relevant laws, we cannot guarantee their compliance with these requirements.</p>

<p>Federal law imposes specific restrictions on website operators who collect and use information from children under the age of 13. We take these age-related requirements seriously and have implemented measures to ensure that our online and mobile resources are not intended for use by children under the age of 18, and especially not by anyone under the age of 13.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 18. If we become aware that personal information has been submitted by someone under the age of 18, we will promptly delete that information and will not use it for any purpose. If you believe that someone under the age of 18 has submitted personal information through our online and mobile resources, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@mediadrops.net">support@mediadrops.net</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage parents and legal guardians to discuss the potential risks of sharing personal information online with their children.</p>

<p>When we collect personal information from California residents, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA").

For the purposes of this section, the terms “you” and “your” refer solely to California residents.</p>

<p>In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information from California residents:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifiers such as name, address, IP address, and other similar identifiers.</li>
    <li>Personal information described in subdivision (e) of Section 1798.80 (California customer records statute), such as name, address, telephone number, and credit card number.</li>
    <li>Commercial information, such as products or services purchased.</li>
    <li>Internet/electronic activity, such as browsing history and search history.</li>
    <li>Geolocation data, including geographic coordinates/physical location.</li>
    <li>Audio, video, electronic, or other similar information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may have disclosed this information for one or more business purposes permitted by the CCPA. Please review this privacy statement to understand the scope of purposes and the sources from which we collect it.

        </h3>
    
<p>We control and operate our online and mobile resources from within the United States of America (the “USA”). Personal information collected through our online and mobile resources may be stored and processed in the USA or any other country where we or our affiliates or third-party vendors maintain facilities.</p>

<p>Although we do not actively block or monitor visitors from other countries, our online and mobile resources, as well as our products and services, are primarily directed at visitors and customers from the USA. To the best of our knowledge, we do not engage in activities that subject us to the data protection and privacy laws of other jurisdictions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) under European law.</p>

<p>However, we have adopted and implemented a Security Program that, by its nature, complies with the material provisions of the GDPR and similar laws. We also commit to abiding by the Standard Contractual Clauses promulgated by the European Commission if we transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the United Kingdom (the “EEA”).</p>

<p>Our obligations under the GDPR are similar to those we have under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Likewise, the rights that California residents have under the CCPA are very similar to those afforded to EEA-based data subjects under the GDPR. Therefore, if you believe we have collected personal information from you while you were in the EEA, we further commit to respecting those rights.</p>
